<h1 id="c1"><b>Mark Zuckerberg </b>, Founder, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
</h1>


  </font></p>



<h2 class="city" id="info">Information</h2>
<p>Mark Zuckerberg, in full Mark Elliot Zuckerberg, (born May 14, 1984, White Plains, New York, U.S.),
    American computer programmer who was cofounder and CEO from (2004) of Facebook, a social networking Web site. 
     After attending Phillips Exeter Academy, Zuckerberg enrolled at Harvard University in 2002.On February 4, 2004, he launched thefacebook.com (renamed Facebook in 2005), a directory in which fellow Harvard students entered their own information and photos into a template that he had devised. Within two weeks half of the student body had signed up. Zuckerberg’s roommates, Dustin Moskovitz and Chris Hughes, helped him add features and make the site available to other campuses across the country. Facebook quickly became popular as registered users could create profiles, upload photos and other media, and keep in touch with friends.
      It differed from other social networking sites, however, in its emphasis on real names (and e-mail addresses), or “trusted connections.” It also laid particular emphasis on networking, 
     with information disseminated not only to each individual’s network of friends but also to friends of friends—what Zuckerberg called the “social graph.”
     His net worth is now estimated at $111.2 (£83.7) billion.</p>
     
<h2 class="city">Achievements</h2>
<p><b><h3>1. He founded Facebook</h3></b>
    Facebook went public in 2012 — a major achievement for Mark Zuckerberg, who launched the tech start-up from his dormitory room at Harvard University.
     Zuckerberg and three of his friends first engineered an earlier version of the mega platform,
     called Thefacebook(dot)com, for sharing photos and contact details. By the end of 2004, Facebook had gained a million users,
     attracting the attention of tech’s most influential companies, but Zuckerberg declined offers to sell. At Facebook’s 2012 IPO,
     Zuckerberg kept a majority share and 50% of the voting rights.<br>
     
     <b><h3>2. He launched innovative programs at an early age</h3></b>
     In middle school, Mark Zuckerberg began working with computers and writing software programs. At age 12, he invented a generic 
     messaging program for his father’s dental practice. As a child, he also developed video games that were based on his friends’ illustrations.
      While a high school student, Zuckerberg interned at the Intelligent Media Group where he worked on and helped develop the largely successful
      Synapse Media Player — a music player that used machine learning to determine users’ listening preferences. Technology giants AOL and
    Microsoft attempted to purchase Synapse for $1 million (£750,000) and tried to recruit Zuckerberg, who enrolled to Harvard University instead.<br>
    <b><h3>3. He brought the internet to remote places</h3></b>
Zuckerberg created internet(dot)org in August 2013, alongside a 10-page paper explaining
 how connectivity should be a human right, and the ultimate aim was to connect some of the remotest areas to the internet.
 Internet(dot)org (renamed FreeBasics in 2015) partners with six other companies — Samsung, MediaTek, Nokia, Ericsson,
 Opera Software and Qualcomm. He wanted to make the internet more affordable, and created an education partnership with Nokia,
 AirTel and edX called SocialEDU, which provides students in Rwanda with free access to numerous educational experiences.<br><h3><b>To Read more</b>

<h2 class="city">College years </h2>
<p><h4>The New Yorker noted that by the time Zuckerberg began classes at Harvard in 2002, he had already achieved a "reputation as a programming prodigy".
   He studied psychology and computer science and belonged to Alpha Epsilon Pi and Kirkland House.
  In his sophomore year, he wrote a program that he called CourseMatch, which allowed users to make class selection decisions based on the choices of other students and also to help them form study groups. A short time later,
   he created a different program he initially called Facemash that let students select the best-looking person from a choice of photos.
    Arie Hasit, Zuckerberg's roommate at the time, explained:</h4><br>

  We had books called Face Books, which included the names and pictures of everyone who lived in the student dorms. 
  At first, he built a site and placed two pictures or pictures of two males and two females.
   Visitors to the site had to choose who was "hotter" and according to the votes there would be a ranking.<br><br>
  
  The site went up over a weekend, but by Monday morning, the college shut it down, because its popularity had overwhelmed one of Harvard's network switches and prevented students
   from accessing the Internet. In addition, many students complained that their photos were being used without permission. 
  Zuckerberg apologized publicly, and the student paper ran articles stating that his site was "completely improper".</p>
 
  <h2 class="city">Other Projects</h2>
<p>A month after Zuckerberg launched Facebook in February 2004, i2hub, another campus-only service, created by Wayne Chang, was launched. 
  i2hub focused on peer-to-peer file sharing. At the time, both i2hub and Facebook were gaining the attention of the press and growing rapidly in users and publicity.
   In August 2004, Zuckerberg, Andrew McCollum, Adam D'Angelo, and Sean Parker launched a competing peer-to-peer file sharing service called Wirehog,
    a precursor to Facebook Platform applications, which launched in 2007.<br>
<br>
  In 2013, Zuckerberg launched Internet.org, which he described as an initiative to provide Internet access to the five billion people without it as of the launch date.
   The project faced significant opposition in India, where activists said its limited internet ran counter to the principle of net neutrality;
    Zuckerberg responded that a limited internet was better than no internet. Internet.org was shut down in India in February 2016,
     although Zuckerberg later met with Narendra Modi to discuss further possibilities.
  <br><br>
  Zuckerberg is a board member of the solar sail spacecraft development project Breakthrough Starshot, which he co-founded in 2016.</p>
